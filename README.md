# ImpactBrands-FigmaProject

The objective of this project was to develop a landing page based on a provided design using industry-standard technologies. The design for the landing page is accessible through a Figma link, which includes a screenshot illustrating the desired layout. The implementation of the landing page entails the utilization of HTML, CSS, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, and adherence to the BEM naming convention.

The design of the landing page showcases a visually captivating layout consisting of various sections and components. Notably, the page incorporates a slider. The integrated slider seamlessly presents and transition between different content or images.
